v.2.1.6:
- Fixed issue caused by last update, CB section not accessible
- Added instructions for various sections
- Added option to create NaN keyword

v.2.1.5:
- Can now force close android if you have the the com.rechild.advancedtaskkiller apk installed
- Backup process has been improved, scripts are fully backed up
- Menu structure changed, now an install content menu for codes, comm. builds and addons
- All paths now pointing to NaN server

v.2.1.4:
- FINALLY Fixed problem with some android and OE devices crashing
- fixed issue with viewport showing as an entry for third party builds put on archive.org
- Now Pointing to new servers for Community Builds so if they don't load just keep trying as it will mean the servers are struggling.

v.2.1.1:
- Added to noobsandnerds repository.
- Removed all instances of global var calls, hopefully may fix android issue.
- Login improved and will only check daily.
- Removed a lot of old code no longer required.
- Added openelec specific stuff:
--- Wi-Fi Settings
--- Create OE Backup
--- Restore OE Backup (from anywhere not just backup folder)
--- Locked CB install option 1 as it's causing boot loop on OE.

v.2.0.9:
- Small bugfix with login, new members weren't being picked up

v.2.0.8:
- NEW ADDON: The Community Portal

- Hopefully fixed the android kick-out issue, can't replicate on any droid devices here at least.

- Addons section completely redone:
--- 2 options for Install method, either the old way or the new recommended way which ensures latest is installed.
--- If addon is installed it will notify you and you can run the addon direct from menu.
--- If addon hasn't installed correctly or updated yet you can force update or just choose option 2.

- Community Builds completely redone:
--- All new builds created will be much smaller in size and will only install content not already on the device.
--- Updates will now only take seconds to do and will only require force close if guisettings has changed.
--- You can now add your own build lists or use this addon to integrate other wizards via the settings.
--- If broken build is found (from third party list) it will try and fix it.
--- If broken build is beyond repair it will notify you rather than crashing out with no message.

- Tutorials:
--- You can now enable/disable all the different tutorials sections, we've left the most popular on by default.


- NEW noobsandnerds keywords:
--- You can now create your own artwork packs, addon packs... anything you want!

INSTRUCTIONS:
Create a zip file of the content you want in your keyword. Example, if you just want to create an addon pack
you would just zip up the addons folder. If you wanted addons AND the addon_data for some of these addons you would
zip up both the addons folder and the userdata/addon_data folder so your zip would look like something like this:

uk_pack.zip
---addons
-------plugin.video.iplayer
-------plugin.video.itv
-------plugin.video.ukplay
---userdata
-------addon_data
---------------plugin.video.iplayer

You can of course zip up absolutely anything you want so get creative, maybe start creating artwork packs that
people can use in their community builds. So long as everyone agrees to use the same file structure they will be
universal. We would recommend for artwork creating a folder called "background_art" in userdata and then all
community builders can link their skins to those folders. So for example you may have something like:

starwars.zip
---userdata
------background_art
---------livetv
------------<pic1.jpg>
------------<pic2.jpg>
---------movies
------------<pic1.jpg>
------------<pic2.jpg>
------------<pic3.jpg>
------------<pic4.jpg>

You get the idea!

Once you've got your zip file upload it to somewhere like archive.org or copy.com, find the final resolved URL
(the one when you type it in a browser it will just start downloading without the need to press a button).
Next just go to http://urlshortbot.com and use the word noobs followed by your keyword. In the starwars example
above we would just type in noobsstarwars as the shortened name and in Kodi we just type "starwars" for
the content to be installed!

DEPRECIATED - OLD TOTAL INSTALLER ADDON
v.2.0.6:
- Totally re-coded the service timing so it uses proper alarm calls. No more lockups.
- Fixed up some dialog messages, now if it doesn't force close it tells user to pull power.
- Fixed wipe kodi option in maintenance
- Fixed RunScript options in settings which had broken.

v.2.0.5:
- Fixed Option 1 (Fresh Install).
- Fixed Wipe option (was failing to keep Total Installer after wipe on Android).
- Added options to keep sources and favourites when installing a community build.
- Added service, this allows for internet connection check and CB notifications.
- Edited main menu so Community Builds always shows as a category but still needs unlocking.

v.2.0.4:
- Added missing countries.
- Fix guisettings step, old builds with TI installed were overwriting the newer version.
- Fix uploadlog for TI (typo in plugin ID for uploadlog module)
- Fix issue with special characters in user/pass.
- Wipe Kodi without the need for restart (load master profile).
- Add Isengard category to both the add-on and web form.

- Improved search functions so not quite as demanding on servers.
- Fixed the download count on add-on portal.
- Added check for download path and login that can be run directly from settings without the need for saving settings. Thank you DixieDean for that tip!

v.2.0.3:
- Small fix on startup video, added a close on the dialog which was covering up the video

v.2.0.2:
- Fixed wipe build option.
- Added internet check on startup.
- Added broken status on addon portal when browsing lists.

v.2.0.1:
- Minor update, some systems didn't like base64

Version 2.0:
- A complete re-write, all my own code apart from the handful of modules not obfuscated.
- The default.py is now obfuscated due to some morons stealing work without crediting the original author and also removing licenses.
Sorry about that, it goes against everything I believe in but until these idiots are dealt with it will stay this way.
